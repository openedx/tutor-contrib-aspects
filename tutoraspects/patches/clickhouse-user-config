IMPORTANT: This patch is not applied to Clickhouse Cloud Providers.
           make sure to contact your cloud provider support to apply this patch.

Override configuration in users.xml. ClickHouse will read this from a mount on
/etc/clickhouse-server/users.d/ on startup.

The http settings revert back to the value from versions pre-23.6,
when the default was changed from 1Mb to 128Kb. This allows larger POSTs such
as the event sink sends from the LMS.

NOTE: Currently this patch does not impact Kubernetes deployments. ClickHouse
writes to the user directory that we want to override causing errors if we try
to mount this file there:

        <http_max_field_name_size>1048576</http_max_field_name_size>
    </default>
